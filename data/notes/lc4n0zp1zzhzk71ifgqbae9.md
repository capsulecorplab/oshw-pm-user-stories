## notes

- annotate any element in a project (e.g., components, aspects of components, steps in instructions, any data structure)
- be able to point to one or more element(s) that it is annotating
- be able to point to one or more "source" element(s), s.a.,
  - a Bib reference
  - another annotation
  - an "analysis artifact"
- be supported in m30ml
- an annotation element is conceptually composed of:
  - **Annotation Content**: descriptive content about the annotation (e.g., page no. in a citation, comment body/text)
  - **Annotated Data Reference**: reference from the annotation itself (source) to the element(s) being annotated (target)
  - **Supporting Data Reference (optional)**: reference from the annotation itself (source) to supporting material (e.g., bib entry for a citation, justification for an agile decision record, image file as part of definition for an instruction step, etc.)
