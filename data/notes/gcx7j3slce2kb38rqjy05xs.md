## notes
- need for bridging knowledge gap between industry standard and open-source practices; no mentoring programs / methodology
  - while the DOF team agrees this is a challenge within the OSHW community, it is outside the scope of DOF (packaging a OSHW project to be shareable/modifiable/reproducible)
- lintable data structure
  - interpret "lintable" to mean the content in the model is verifiable (no missing fields, orphan elements, etc.)
  - LinkML "validate" capability implements these kinds of tests
  - a.k.a., expose ability to validate content
