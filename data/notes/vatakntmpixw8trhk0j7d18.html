<ul>
<li>diffs are useless unless you pay for a service</li>
<li>openscad - jump to microelectronics</li>
<li>challenge getting into digital space</li>
<li>"structural diffing" - see diff tastic</li>
<li>need for name-spacing; unambiguous means of referencing component instances
<ul>
<li>need a means of mapping dof schema to other tools (e.g., KiCad, FreeCAD)
<ul>
<li>this enables referencing data (s.a., part description) in DOF to enhance understanding data in other tools (e.g., what is the purpose of capacitor C2 in board layout)</li>
<li>this enables deeper referencing within instructions (e.g., where to place capacitor on a board based on board layout within assembly instructions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>any instance of a component in DOF needs to have a (fully qualified?) singular definitive name; this should be one-to-one and onto
<ul>
<li>investigate connection between structural diffing and mapping to other tools in user stories</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>need context as to why a design was changed (e.g., a capacitor was swapped out or removed), or any design decision
<ul>
<li>this is a kind of annotation capability that should
<ul>
<li>annotate any element in a project (e.g., components, aspects of components, steps in instructions, any data structure)</li>
<li>include ability to leave commentary</li>
<li>be able to point to one or more element(s) that it is annotating</li>
<li>be able to point to one or more "source" element(s), s.a.,
<ul>
<li>a Bib reference</li>
<li>another annotation</li>
<li>an "analysis artifact"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be supported in m30ml</li>
</ul>
