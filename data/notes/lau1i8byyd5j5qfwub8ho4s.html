<ul>
<li>references should only be able to reference elements within the scope of the element that owns the reference (i.e., elements are unaware of parent or sibling elements; relationships between siblings are defined in a parent element)</li>
<li>views reference elements
<ul>
<li>views are always siblings to elements</li>
<li>therefore, a view must be provided element(s) as input</li>
<li>elements that views are provided as input are provided via an interface into said view</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>references are a 1-to-1 or 1-to-many relationship</li>
<li>e.g., I might want to import my Universal Controller into another project but be able to mention that you need to plug something into a particular port on the Raspberry Pi. Would like there to be a way to reference it like parts.universal-controller.parts.raspberry-pi.description (in legacy DOF)</li>
<li>references may be implemented as a qualified names (i.e., relative file path names or fully qualified domain names)</li>
</ul>
